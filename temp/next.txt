errors:

In test state, return to home page, doesn't work + change is so that Enter or any other input directs the user back to home page

completed:

ADDED - add Line class to print lines, basic structure has already been added
FIXED - line 118 ui_components.py, beautify_rows parameter doesn't work since in some cases column_settings is None, thus loop is never iterated.
ADDED - create a library/file to handle terminal (user interface) regarding commands such as beautification commands (dash lines, etc)
ADDED - add page to see information regarded text using text id or dictionary mode
