completed:

FIXED - In Panel class, if inner_text_padding(right) is so much that the net table size is greater than the terminal width, the text changes instead of the inner_text_padding(left)
ADDED - In Panel class, add an option to add multiple inner texts in different boxes attached to one panel
ADDED - In Panel Class, add an option to add header
ADDED - add Line class to print lines, basic structure has already been added
FIXED - line 118 ui_components.py, beautify_rows parameter doesn't work since in some cases column_settings is None, thus loop is never iterated.
ADDED - create a library/file to handle terminal (user interface) regarding commands such as beautification commands (dash lines, etc)
ADDED - add page to see information regarded text using text id or dictionary mode

MODIFICATIONS:
-> Panel class, multiple inner text feature addition:
- removed default_width option from set_inner_text option, since multiple inner_text will added
- renamed set_inner_text to add_inner_text
