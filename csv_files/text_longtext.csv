1,"Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high! Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden.

4,"He never went out without a book under his arm, and he often came back with two. He had a smile for everyone, a tear in his eye for the misfortunes of others, and a steady courage for his own. His soul was as open as a child’s; and yet it was full of strength, drawn from the vastness of love and kindness which he bore within him. To know him was to understand that gentleness and strength are not opposites, but companions.",Les Misérables,Victor Hugo
